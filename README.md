## Notes-App---with-dagger-hilt
 This app can be used to create and save notes.
 This app is a good demonstration of how to use dagger hilt as a dependency injection technique. 
 Simply, it replaces the manual way of injecting dependencies which may be time consuming. 

## Features
 1. Creating a note : users can easily create a new note by clicking on the add note floating action button
 2. Editting a note : Users can edit an existing note by tapping on that particular app
 3. Searching for a note : The app allows the users to search for a particular note on the list, by the note's title or note's content
 4. Deleting a note : The app also allows its users to delete any note in the list. This is achieved by long pressing on that particualar note
 5. Dynamic note coloring : The user doesn't need to explicitly set the color for the created note but instead the app does that.

## Features
* Extensive user verificaction. Yes, if you are unable to verify user's input in your apps I would recommend you check this.
* Response to dark and light modes. The app is responsive to toggling of themes on your device.

## Technology
The app uses the following technologies:
* [Room Database](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) - User data is stored locally with the aid of room database
* [Dagger Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) - for dependency injection
* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) programming language
* [XML](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-training-xml-layouts#0) for UI development

## Architecture
