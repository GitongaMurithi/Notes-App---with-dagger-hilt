# Notes-App---with-dagger-hilt
## This app can be used to create and save notes.
## This app is a good demonstration of how to use dagger hilt as a dependency injection technique. 
## Simply, it replaces the manual way of injecting dependencies which may be time consuming. 

# Features
## 1. Creating a note : users can easily create a new note by clicking on the add note floating action button
## 2. Editting a note : Users can edit an existing note by tapping on that particular app
## 3. Searching for a note : The app allows the users to search for a particular note on the list, by the note's title or note's content
## 4. Deleting a note : The app also allows its users to delete any note in the list. This is achieved by long pressing on that particualar note
## 5. Dynamic note coloring : The user doesn't need to explicitly set the color for the created note but instead the app does that
